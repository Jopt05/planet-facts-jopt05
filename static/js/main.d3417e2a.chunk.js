Like that of Earth, Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity.

A possible cause is an impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter\'s formation, which would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"The best known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22\xb0 south of the equator.
